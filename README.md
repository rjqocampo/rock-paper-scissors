# Bato, Bato, Pik

Welcome to Bato, Bato, Pik!

This project provides an interactive way to play the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game in your web browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Other tools used:
  
  * Github Pages for free hosting
  * Git for version control
  * Figma for mockup
  * Chrome DevTools for debugging
  * Google Fonts for web fonts
  * Visual Studio Code for IDE

### Motivation
To practice and solidify my Javascript and CSS fundamentals

### My Learnings
* Value of conditional statements
* Importance of functions, event listeners and DOM manipulation
* Value of chrome dev tools to inspect layout
* How fonts vary from OS to OS. Encountered a layout bug that was present on Windows, but not on Xubuntu, where I built it. The line height of the web font was significally larger on Windows, distorting the whole layout.  

### Known Issues
* Delay on initial load of images

### Prospective Updates
* Animations for better user feedback

### Game Rules

The rules of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game are the same as always. The only difference is the words used are in Tagalog, one of the major language used in the Philippines.

* Bato beats Gunting
* Gunting beats Papel
* Papel beats Bato

Both the player and the computer select one of the three options, and the winner of the round is determined by the rules above. First to reach 5 wins the game.

### How-to

1. Click on the "Bato", "Papel", or "Gunting" buttons to make your choice.

2. The current score of the game will be displayed on the screen. Including the round being played and the result of the last round.

3. The first to score 5 wins the game. You can choose to play again after.
